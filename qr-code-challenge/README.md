## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Adjusting the box-shadow property to the image given was a bit of a challenge for me. What made it easier was that I put the photo and my version next to one another so I can make the necessary modifications if it was too dark or too light.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0px 0.1px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```
